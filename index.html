    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm an 18-year-old high school student in AP Computer Science Principles. I initially joined the class knowing Python and basic things about coding as a whole, but I've been able to learn much more joining this class. I am now comfortable with JavaScript, as well as using HTML and CSS with my JavaScript to create my own projects. </p>
    <p>The hardest part of this class was remembering all of the formatting and different tools. I know now that it is normal to still ask for help or use resources in order to code my projects with better confidence. One of the biggest things I learned was to be comfortable with my ability to use technology and understand the fundamentals that I never really understood before.   </p>
    <p>My goal for this class was to explore coding further and see if it was something I could pursue. I ended up learning not only new languages, but problem solving in this field. I learned how important collaboration is in coding, and not being afraid of making mistakes. I learned that no matter how hard something seems or looks, I can always learn new tips and tricks in coding.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, I can continue to grow my knowledge in coding and eventually use these built up skills to create more substantial projects with use outside of this classroom. My goal would be to create a website that could help real people in a good way, whatever that may look like. </p>
