# Cathalina L. - Final Portfolio Project

## About Me

Hi, I’m Cathalina L., an 18-year-old high school student currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles. Over the past year, I have expanded my skills from basic Python knowledge to becoming comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through this journey, I’ve gained confidence in coding and learned how to approach problem-solving creatively. Collaboration and embracing mistakes have been important lessons that helped me grow as a student developer.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project represents the culmination of what I have learned throughout the year in my computer science class. It showcases my ability to create responsive, interactive web pages using core web technologies. Beyond just coding, I improved my design skills, learned to organize projects effectively, and polished my communication by describing my work clearly for others.

## Portfolio Website Features

My portfolio site includes:

- A personalized homepage with an introduction and navigation
- An “About Me” section highlighting my background and coding journey
- A “Projects” section showcasing several of my coding projects, each with a description and link
- Responsive and visually appealing design with easy navigation
- Consistent use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality and styling
